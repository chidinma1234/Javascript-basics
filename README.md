## Question 6

Statistically typed
1.Type checking is done at compile time
2.If we try to change data type of an already declared variable by assigning a value of other data type into it, then we will get error
3.If we try to change data type by redeclaring an already declared variable (int count) using other data type (boolean count) then also we will get error
Example : Java, C, C++, Go, Swift etc

Dynamically typed
1.Type checking is done at runtime.
2.we can easily change data type of an already declared variable, by assigning a value of other data type into it, no error.
3.we can easily change data type of an already declared variable, by redeclaring it using value of other data type, no error
Example : Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby etc.

## Question 7

Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.

var test1 = null;
console.log(test1);
// null

Undefined
Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined. For example:

var test2;
console.log(test2);
// undefined
